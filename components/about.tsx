      <p className="mb-3">
        After graduating with a degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Mechanical Engineering</span>, I
        discovered a strong interest in technology and started learning to code.
        Over time, I became a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">MERN stack developer</span> and also began
        working with <span className="font-medium">AI agents</span> using models
        like OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini. I enjoy solving real-world problems
        through code and building useful web applications. My core stack
        includes{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB
        </span>
        , and I'm also comfortable with{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">TypeScript</span>. I'm always eager to
        learn and grow as a developer, and currently looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time software development role</span>
        .
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, youâ€™ll usually find
        me at the gym, cooking something new, or playing video games. I also
        enjoy exploring new ideas and keeping up with the latest in tech and AI.
